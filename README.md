# Railway reservation software

Hi, I am Rakesh Kar. This is a simple Railway reservation software made using JAVA. As database, MySQL is used.
This software has 2 functionality. One is admin panel, other is user panel. The admin can manage all the train schedule and ticket price, can add or delete / update trains. Admin can also check the users. The user mode allows to buy tickets and also show already bought tickets against a unique identifier of user.
This project was done with the help of Tutus Funny YouTube channels videos.
